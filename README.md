# JSON Page Layout (JPL)

JSON Page Layout is a system that allows you to simply store webpage layouts using JSON. This repository contains tools that are useful for implementing it, such as:

* JSON schema for JPL files
* Markdown and HTML converters
* A sample server that uses this system

The JPL schema is also available at <https://turnoffthetv.xyz/jpl.json>.
